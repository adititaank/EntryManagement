# EntryManagementInnovacer
Innovacer SummerGeeks 2020 Assignment
Introduction-Entry Management Innovacer is a software biuld to manage the entries made by visitors to meet the hosts at Innovaccer Office.

## Tech-Stack Used
- Android Studio
- Firebase
- Java Mail API

## Approach
I thought of this software as a simple entry management done at the gate entry. The current way to make entry is to write your details and that of the host in a register while making an entry and signing that entry with your signature. I have tried to bring the same process in an application on which the visitor can easily make an entry.
